# 🗳️ Vote Me Not! [Demo]

**Vote Me Not!** is a **2D Satirical Political MOBILE Game** where players take on the role of a moral arbiter, deciding which politicians should run for office—or be sent packing. In a world full of flawed candidates, questionable policies, and suspicious smiles, it's up to *you* to sift through the nonsense and determine who's fit to lead.

Inspired by the game *"That's Not My Neighbor"*, but with a sharp political twist.

## 🧠 Core Concept

In **Vote Me Not!**, every round introduces a series of politicians—each with questionable backgrounds, oddball policies, and hidden agendas. Your job is to:

- **Investigate** candidates
- **Review** their issues, their stances, and political profiles
- **Accept or Reject** them based on how “qualified” they are (or not)
- Survive the public backlash (and absurdity) of modern politics

No one is perfect, but some are *a little too imperfect*.
